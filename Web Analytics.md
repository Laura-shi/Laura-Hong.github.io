# How to setup your website #
<li>Purchasing and Registering your domain name <li>
<li>Registering and Hosting</li>
<ol>
  <li>Select domain name free</li>
  <li>Purchase domain name $$ </li>
  <li>Purchase folder space asa Hosting $$$</li>
</ol>

## Who registers the domain name ##
<li>All domain names are maintained by <strong>ICANN</strong> (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)</li>
<li><strong>ICANN </strong>then has authorized “resellers” who sell available domain names</li>
<li>Some of the very popular resellers are<br>
• DREAMHOST<br>
• BLUEHOST<br>
• And 1000’s more...
</li>

## Resellers like Dreamhost.com ##
<li>Resellers like Dreamhost are also in the business of selling “server space” for storing your website files in the cloud</li>
<li>Resellers (hosting companies) perform the following 3 
services for you that we are interested in:
<ol>
  <li>You can purchase the domain name from them</li>
  <li>You can purchase hosting space from them</li>
  <li>You can install WordPress directly from their site for free wit One-Click Install</li>
</ol>
</li>

## Building your website ##
<li>We will use WordPress to build our websites.</li>
<li>WordPress is a CMS (content management system)</li>
<li>It has its own database and manages all your website files.</li>
<li>WordPress is a very popular website building software.</li>
<li>It requires no programing skills to update and maintain</li>
<li>It provides structure, functionality and standards</li>
<li>It retains about 35% of market share for building websites</li>

## About WordPress ##
<li>There are two different versions of WordPress installations.</li>
<li>WordPress.com (a web services company that packages WordPress for you) and WordPress.org (the open source community)</li>
<li>WordPress.com is basically a website hosting company where you can create a free account and create your own site or blog. It is a bit restricted in what it allows you to do.</li>
<li>WordPress.org is an open source site that maintains the main code of WordPress. It has a lot of advantages. </li>
<li>your “hosting company” (not Wordpress.com – avoid this) will grab the OPEN-SOURCE code and install for you with One-Click Install. This is the one I REQUIRE you to use.</li>

### WordPress.org ###
<li>WordPress is the application which is maintained and supported by <br>
WordPress.org (a community site)</li>
<li>We will work with the FULL SOURCE CODE with free crowd support from Wordpress.org </li>
<li>We will use DREAMHOST.COM hosting company (if I am hosting for you) to get the code for us</li>
<li>AVOID - Wordpress.com because it limits your control with Google Analytics and gives you limited accessibility to themes and plugins. DO NOT USE.</li>

## Secure websites - http vs https ##
<li>Google has moved towards https </li>
<li>Encrypted transfer of information</li>
<li>May have small ranking advantage</li>
<li>All secure sites can be secured for free by the hosting company </li>
<li>STEPS FOR WORDPRESS SITE <br>
• Activate FREE SSL certificate option from hosting provider  <br>
• Add SSL plugin within WordPress (you will do this)</li>

## Select Free SSL certificate ##
<li>Select Free SSL certificate</li>
<ol>
  <li>https://   vs. http://</li>
  <li>Good to get https:// if you are an e-commerce site</li>
  <li>Not all hosting providers provide free SSL certificates</li>
  <li>FULLY HOSTED STEP COMPLETE; WORDPRESS INSTALL COMPLETE</li>
  <li>Dreamhost offers these options</li>
</ol>
## WordPress – Get started ## 
<li>Create a GMAIL address for your e-biz now to use 
with your project throughout the semester</li>
<li>Test your login<br>
• Does the website back-end login come up by typing in the URL below? <br>
• Test your login <br>
www.<yourwebsite>.com/wp-
admin         or
www.<yourwebsite>.com/wp-
admin.php</li>
<li>for example, log in my website Lets Win Kicks: www.</li>

## Wordpress – some initial cleanup ##
<li>Fix the Permalink (Settings>Permalinks)</li>
<li>Fix the timezone (Settings>General)</li>
<li>Fix the Site Title (Appearance>Customize)</li>
  
  
### Permalinks ###
<li>A permalink is what a web user will use to link to your page. It is preferable to set your permalink to something that is more readable</li>
<li>Typically when you navigate to another page you will find ?, # and numbers with some ineligible text. Change this to a more readable format.</li>
<li>Dashboard>Settings>Permalink</li>
<li>Select Postname</li>

## Starting with WordPress and plugins ##
<li>Dashboard>Plugins</li>
<li>Install/Activate Really Simple SSL plugin – to complete https setup</li>
<li>Install/Activate plugin – Akismet plugin (anti-spam) – FREE version </li>
<li>Set your Permalinks</li>

  
## The power of open-source WordPress - plugins ## 
<li>Plugins are small programs that extend the functionality of WordPress in unlimited ways.</li>
<li>Each plugin that you “hook” into your WordPress installation provides a small independent function.</li>
<li>You as the website builder select and install various plugins.</li>
<li>Plugins are plug-and-play – they can be activated and de-activated easily.</li>
<li>Some plugins come “out-of-the-box” with WordPress but may need to be activated.</li>
