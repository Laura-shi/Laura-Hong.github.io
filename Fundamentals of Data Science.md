# Fundamentals of Data Science #
### 1. What is Data? ###
##### * Data is a reprensation of Facts or ideas in a formalized manner capable of being communicate and manicated and manipulated by some process. #####
##### * Data is produced ata nearly exabytes daily (weather, transactional,financial,social, research,archival,...) ##### 
##### * Data is an event of some energy pattern in the physical world hitting a sensor and being recorded somewhere. #####

### 2. Standard Methodology ###
<ol>* Problem Definition/goal
  <li>Identify/specify goals of the data analysis</li>
  <li>commit to specific deliverables</li>
</ol>
</ol> * Data pro-cessing 
  <li> Identify appropriate data</li>
  <li> Acquire data (gather, lookup,understand)<br> Necessary/Relevant? Sufficient?Cleansed?</li>
</ol>
<ol> * Data Processing
  <li>Identify methods(gather,cleansse,store)</li>
  <li>Carry out the analysis(patterns,trend,preditions?)</li>
</ol>
<ol> * Data post-processing
    <li>Visualize and present</li>
    <li>Deploy and evaluate. Iterate, if necessary</li>
</ol>

### 3. Data Life Cycle ###
<li> Analysis </li>
<li> Application </li>
<li> Pre-processing </li>   

### 4.What is Data Science (DS)? ###
#### * Fundamentals of DS is to turn data into information and knowledge ####
#### * DS is interdisciplinary/requires a lot of help to be effective ####

### 5.Major Kinds of Problems in DS ###
### Most problems in DS reduce to three fundamental kinds of problems, all of them computational problems ###
#### Classification #### 
#### Prediction ####
#### Clustering ####
    
## Why pre-processing? ##   
<p> "A company's most important asset is information. A corporation's ability to compete, adapt, and grow in a business climate of rapid change is dependent in large measure on how well the company uses information to make decisions...<br> Sharing information that isn't clean and consolidated to the fullest extent can substantially reduce the effectiveness of a system of significant investment and considerable pay-off potential."
</p>

## How to understand your data corpus? ##
<li>A data corpus consists of a finite number of data tables, possible of varius dimensions, comprising all the data for the project</li>
<li>A data point(or record)is an nDimensional vector of features/predictors/variables/attributes/columns:
  <li> * Each value is alphabetic or numeric</li>
  <li> * Usually n>> 1 (n is the dimensionality of the point)</li>
</li>
<li>Oranize your data by clustering points of the same dem into data tables(attributes are column headers; data points/records are the rows/tuples)</li>
<li>If at all possible, design an ontology(way to organize the data) to have a better chance of understanding the corpus</li>


## Storage Methods ##
<p>
  <ol>Databases
    <li> *Digital files, Spreadsheets(excel)</li>
    <li> *Databases(hierarchical,relational,nonrelational) MySQL, Oracle, SAS SysBase,...</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>Dtawarhouses/farms
    <li>Central repositories of entire data corpora of an organization(usually very large) data</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>Data Banks
    <li>Centralized organizations storing all kinds of data for creation,public access/transaction</li>
  </ol>
  <ol>Clouds
    <li>Repositionries of heterogeneous from multiple sources data and means to crunch it</li>
  </ol>
</p>
