<p>Left: Data simulate from f, shown in black. Three estimates of f are shown: the linear regression line(orange curve),and two smoothing spline fits(blue and green curves). Right: Traning MSE (grey curve),test MSE(red curve), and minimum possible test MSE over all methods(dashed line).</p>
<p><strong>In the right panel, as the flexibility of the statistical learning method increases, we obeseve a monotone decrease in the traning MSE and a U-shape in the test MSE. This is a fundamental property of statistical learning that holds regardless of the particular data set at hand and regardless of statistical learning method being used.</strong></p>
